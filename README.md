A Ruby library for generating QR Codes and e-invoices according to the standard created by ZATCA in Saudi Arabia.

This library supports both Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 2 support is still new so there may be bugs. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/obahareth/zatca/issues/new) you find.

# Installation

## Rubygems
```sh
gem install zatca-sdk
```

## Bundler
```sh
bundle add zatca-sdk
```

## Migrating from Original Version
If you were using the original version of this library, you can migrate to the new version by changing the gem name in your Gemfile from `zatca` to `zatca-sdk`.

As of this moment there are no new changes to the API, so you should be able to use the new version without any changes to your code.

This fork was made because my access to the original repository was removed and I wanted to continue maintaining the library.

# Usage

## Phase 1
```rb
require "zatca"

tags = {
  seller_name: "Mrsool",
  vat_registration_number: "310228833400003",
  timestamp: "2021-10-20T19:29:32+03:00",
  vat_total: "15",
  invoice_total: "115",
}

ZATCA.render_qr_code(tags: tags)
# => data:image/png;base64,...
# Hint (Try pasting the above into your web browser's address bar)
```

If you'd like to customize the size of the QR Code you can manually use the generator like so:

```rb
require "zatca"

tags = ZATCA::Tags.new({
  seller_name: "Mrsool",
  vat_registration_number: "310228833400003",
  timestamp: "2021-10-20T19:29:32+03:00",
  vat_total: "15",
  invoice_total: "115",
})

generator = ZATCA::QRCodeGenerator.new(tags: tags)
generator.render(size: 512)
```
